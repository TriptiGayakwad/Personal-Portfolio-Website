# Personal Portfolio

My personal website showcasing my work as a frontend developer.

## About

This is my portfolio website where I share my projects and a bit about myself. I built it using just HTML and CSS to keep things simple and fast.

## What's Inside

- Clean, responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Gradient background with some nice visual effects
- Two of my recent projects
- Contact info and links

## Projects

**Age Calculator** - A tool that calculates your exact age down to the days. Pretty handy for those "how old am I exactly?" moments.

**Email Sorter** - Helps organize emails automatically. Still working on improving the sorting logic.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (for the projects)

## Running Locally

Just download the files and open `index.html` in your browser. That's it!

Or if you want to use a local server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
